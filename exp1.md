# Study of Various C++ Compilers

C++ is named as a compiled language due to a lot of work done by the compilers. here is the list of c++ compilers which will do for both c and c++, differed by their file extension (for c it is (.C) extension, For C++ it is .cpp extension). Using the editor’s C++ source file is generated and the compiler is invoked to give an executable file and finally, the name of the file is executed to produce the result. Below is a list of different compilers allowing us to compile the source code on the different platforms.



## 1. MinGW:
It’s an opensource tool with no third-party requirements and works well with the development of Microsoft windows. It has GCC compilers to include C, C++, Fortran language compilers. Among many other tools, this compiler is liked most by the user due to the high level of portability available in GCC by ANSI Compliance. Windows 32 or min32 makes to create an individual project and added with different packages and licensed in their own versions. G++ provides us with the complete source code. A key benefit of it is fast and simple and requires DLL libraries.

## 2. Borland C++:
This is the oldest and cheaper compiler which do not have any competitors in the market. Borland is a C++ integrated development environment and it is most widely used in the 90’s works well in MS-DOS Prompt and Windows. They make simple editing features making their code easier and simple.

## 3. Dev C++:
Dev C++ takes a combination of GCC along with Cygwin port as a compiler helps in editing and compiling resource files. It’s an open-source environment and sufficient for the new learners of the C++ program. This IDE or compiler is written in Delphi and comes with DevOps. The key benefit of it is can be installed and execute on a flash drive makes a full featured Compiler.

## 4. Embarcadero C++ builder:
It’s an open-source Compiler for windows meant for commercial purposes. It supports language extensions, libraries, good UI design and considered to be a cross platform from Windows, IOS, Android. Students can utilize it at free of charge as they have published with a new command-line compiler. This tool is enabling to deliver the applications faster and insecure platforms in the competitive market.

## 5. Clang:
Clang compiler is preferred to be easily understandable compiler provided with front end with more fast and reduced memory adapted with a BSD license. A good feature of Clang is its GCC compatibility and its design is based on LLVM. It is built for a better analysis of the code with faster compilation. The three phases of a compiler include a parser to build the Abstract Syntax tree at the front end, the second phase includes the optimizer, the final is the back end. Therefore, they are considered to be the important mainstream compiler in the industry. Clang is considered to be a good compiler to build a tool and to reuse, integrate with other projects too.

## 6. Visual C++:
The development of Visual C++ has migrated to new technology by Microsoft in the year 1993. Microsoft strategy has achieved new features with the class library which gains the greatest productivity and gives an integrated environment for professional C++ developers. A key feature of Visual C++ is the development of MFC architecture which provides the fastest executables, developing windows-based applications. Most importantly, to get better compatibility MFC 2.0 is been used for a good subset of C++ to make the framework much portable. They give you a family of products and provides a path to develop windows applications in 32-bit to have the safest run on multiple hardware and software, meanwhile incorporating OLE development where users burden is reduced on writing code. And it can be executable on commercially provided compiler supporting component-based software to evolve.

## 7. Intel C++:
Intel C++ or named as ICC is developed by Intel corporation with embedded New Intel architectures, this program compiles C and C++ and comes with a commercial license, the version 11.0 of it provides RPMs. They contain highly targeted Cache work and SIMD instructions. This compiler processes the job faster and more effective and advantageous than GCC. Intel C++ has an identical performance where other compiler faces scalar instructions. The key attribute of Intel is their flexibility, switching between the compilers is easy and preferred much by the software developers.

## 8. Code block:
The code block is a free cross-platform c++ compiler and supports multiple platform compilers. It includes features like debugger, breakpoints in the code and multi-compilers. A super benefit of the Code block is they operate on different Operating Systems and do not require translating languages for their operations
